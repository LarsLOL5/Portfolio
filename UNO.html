                            This game I worked on at my internship at Wanted 5 Games. UNO Car Party! was already released and they were working on a big update. 
                            My tasks involved around a couple different things. Most of the time I was bug fixing. So there is a task of what was going wrong.
                            Then I start gathering the scripts which have something to do with the bug. After that I start checking variables that are possible involved with the bug.
                            And after I found the bug, I will fix it. But also sometimes I was implementing features. Most of those times it's art that needs to be implemented into Cocos Creator.
                            And a lot of those times I also needed to code for the art to work nicely.

                            What challenges did I face?

                            At first I thought the language and engine would be the hardest, but that was less hard then expected. 
                            The biggest problem faced was the project itself. 
                            It was way bigger then any project I have seen so far. So in the beginning the code felt like a maze to me.
                            But after doing a lot of searching and coding in the code, it became more and more easy to find my way in.

                            What did I learn from it?
                        </h4>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            In this project I learned to be a developer who can work well in a team. First I learned a lot about TypeScript and JavaScript by watching tutorials
                            and reading articles. And after that I was assigned to work on Uno Car Party! During the project I learned to search and find curtain things in a large code base.
                            And of course learned to write better TypeScript + getting better in Cocos Creator.
