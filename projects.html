                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            Before I went to the GLU, I had never even touch a code language. I literally started from square one. In the beginning of my education I was quite struggeling 
                            and it also didn't help that I was sick in one of the first weeks. I was falling behind a bit. 
                            Then after the first few weeks school offered some extra help to the students who where just like me, struggeling a bit to keep up or didn't understand curtain things.
                            After the first few months I maneged to turn things around. I understood everything better and it was all going better. 
                            From the moment onwards I was only in a upwards spiral. My grades got better and my motivation had never been so high. Even to this day, my moviation is incredibly high. 
                            Back in middle school, my motivation was never there. But since I go to school here, that has changed. Even tho i have to travel 4 hours every day, its so worth it.
                            Cause this has become my passion and I am so happy with all my choices I have made. So in conclusion: you can achieve everything in life, if you work hard enough for it.

                            This was our first project working with artists. We made this game with 6 people total, 3 game developers and 3 game artists.
                            Tho 1 developer and 2 artists did nothing, so in reality we where with 3. We had 4 weeks total for this project.

                            There where a couple of problems. First that only 50% of our group did something. Second that we where learned how to use Git and the artits didn't.
                            And Last was that my knowlodge wasn't that big yet, so i was struggeling with basic code things.

                            I made the enemy wave system, back then I didn't know how to place them in groups, so... I played them ONE BY ONE.

                            I also made the map (cause we only had 1 working artists) and script wise I made the player shooting mechanic.

                            Our last project of the first year. This time we where with 5 people, 2 game developers and 3 game artists. 
                            For this project we had 8 weeks. The first 4 weeks we needed to build an alpha version with a lot of requires from school.
                            In the last 4 weeks tho, we where free to build whatever we liked.

                            This was our most recent group project made with artists. And it was the biggest group so far, with 7 people total. 
                            Before this project we had 2 weeks practice on how to build the car and tweek it.
                            So I came prepaired going into this project. In this 4 week project we make an night-themed street circuit that is based on the real streets of Tokyo.
                            So thats why we chose the name.

                            The communication with some artists wasn't too great. We both had different ideas for the game so it was hard to go on one line.

                            Mine main task for this project was the player. I needed to "build" the car and let it drive smoothly.
                            It also needed to have a boost.
