                            This was our first project working with artists. We made this game with 6 people total, 3 game developers and 3 game artists.
                            Tho 1 developer and 2 artists did nothing, so in reality we where with 3. We had 4 weeks total for this project.

                            There where a couple of problems. First that only 50% of our group did something. Second that we where learned how to use Git and the artits didn't.
                            And Last was that my knowlodge wasn't that big yet, so i was struggeling with basic code things.

                            I made the enemy wave system, back then I didn't know how to place them in groups, so... I played them ONE BY ONE.

                            I also made the map (cause we only had 1 working artists) and script wise I made the player shooting mechanic.
